# Custom Log In Screen

This is an example app, used to show flutter animations for clean UI and UX. 

Although the desired design was achieved and ran great on an Emulator, older phones will probably struggle to keep this up with 60 fps, since it takes a lot of mathematical computation to make and animate the path. However, the performance can improve with some updates.


Design inspired by [Dimest@dribbble](https://dribbble.com/Dimest)

The final login button border is off by a few pixels on 16:9 resolutions. Can/Will be fixed.

Although I can it make it look more like the actual original design (like the login button animation), the focus of the app (which was the line path animation) was achieved.
